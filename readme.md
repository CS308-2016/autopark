Project Description:

Why AutoPark?
In our daily lives when we are out for shopping or travelling we face some common parking related problems like :
Not being able to park close to our destination
Not finding a space to park
Finding that a space meant for a car has been taken over by bikes!
AutoPark not only helps to solve the above mentioned problems but also acts a parking control manager which can issue parking tickets and fines if rules are violated thus reducing the human effort of police.

The main idea behind AutoPark is to reduce the hassle of parking space search and allotment.
AutoPark can be implemented in 2 main ways i.e. through an app(virtually) and also through a booth type approach(physically)
These boothâ€™s will be stationed at the entrances of major shopping malls, business areas, educational institutes etc.
Each booth will have the information about all the parking spots associated with its particular area.

When a vehicle enters the area, the booth will identify the type of the vehicle (car, bike etc.) and correspondingly allocate (if free) a parking spot to it for a fixed time limit. 
The user will be issued a ticket stating the spot number. 
If the user tries to park in a different spot or if he exceeds the time allocated to him the he will be fined accordingly as the booth knows the info of the user which user has to provide during the entry.
There will be sensors present at the spots to ensure whether the spot is free or not and if the correct vehicle is in it or not.
